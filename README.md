# Caesar
2D side scroller built with Unity for "Julius Caesar" by Shakespeare

## Story
You play as a time traveller who lost his copy of Julius Caesar by William Shakespeare in the past. You must collect the pages of the play while avoiding characters in order to prevent a time paradox by touching them. As you are collecting pages of scenes, the very scenes are unfolding as dialogue from the play is transcribed. Once you have collected all the pages, you must continue to avoid characters from the scene until it has played out. 

## Gameplay
The gameplay is extremely straightforward. Clicking will make you jump. The challenge, however, arrives when you must times the jumps right in order to jump over the characters.

## Technology
- The scripts were programmed in C#
- The pixel art was done in Pixen
